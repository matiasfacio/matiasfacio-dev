          <p>
            Hello, I'm Matias, a Berlin-based Frontend developer with a focus on
            crafting Web applications using React.js and Next.js. My programming
            journey spans several years, during which I've worked extensively
            with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Since 2019, React.js has been a
            central part of my toolkit.
            <br />
            <br />
            Fluent in Spanish, English, and German, I studied IT for four years
            in Patagonia, Argentina. Despite initially following an artistic
            path, I found myself consistently engaged in programmingâ€”creating
            websites, editing videos, and designing graphics for projects and
            friends.
            <br />
            <br />
            In 2019, I made a conscious decision to return to programming
            professionally and chose React.js after a friend's recommendation.
            The experience was transformative, and I quickly developed a strong
            affinity for its capabilities.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you're interested in potential collaboration, don't hesitate to
            reach out. I'm eager to connect. Thank you.
